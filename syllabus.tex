\section*{Course Description}
This course provides a rigorous introduction to Scientific Machine Learning (SciML), focusing on the development, analysis, and application of machine learning techniques for solving complex problems governed by ordinary and partial differential equations (ODEs/PDEs). Bridging numerical analysis, scientific computing, and deep learning, SciML offers novel computational paradigms for challenges where traditional methods face limitations, such as high-dimensional problems, inverse problems, and systems with incomplete physical knowledge.

We will delve into the mathematical foundations underpinning modern SciML solvers. Key topics include Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs), and Operator Learning frameworks (e.g., DeepONets, Fourier Neural Operators), which learn mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces. The course will explore the theoretical basis for these methods, including function approximation theory in relevant spaces (e.g., Sobolev spaces), the role of automatic differentiation for computing derivatives and residuals, and the specific optimization challenges encountered when training physics-informed models.

Emphasis will be placed on formulating differential equations as learning problems, analyzing the properties of different SciML architectures and loss functions, understanding techniques for enforcing boundary conditions, and evaluating the convergence and accuracy of the resulting solutions. We will also cover methods for uncertainty quantification, transfer learning approaches, and explore the discovery of governing equations from data. Practical implementation will be demonstrated using modern frameworks like PyTorch, JAX, and TensorFlow, enabling students to apply these advanced computational techniques to challenging scientific and engineering problems.

\section*{Learning Outcomes}
Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Formulate scientific problems governed by ODEs/PDEs within machine learning frameworks; implement, train, and evaluate core methods like Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), Neural ODEs, and Operator Learning techniques, including appropriate handling of boundary conditions and sampling strategies.
	\item Analyze the mathematical underpinnings of SciML methods, including relevant function approximation theory (e.g., Universal Approximation Theorems in Sobolev spaces) and the specific optimization challenges (loss landscapes, convergence properties) associated with physics-informed training.
	\item Implement transfer learning approaches for domain adaptation in physical systems and apply few-shot learning techniques for rapid adaptation to new physical regimes with limited data.
	\item Implement and interpret methods for uncertainty quantification (e.g., Bayesian Neural Networks, Gaussian Processes) and data-driven discovery of governing differential equations (e.g., SINDy) within scientific applications.
	\item Critically assess the applicability, performance characteristics (accuracy, convergence, cost), and limitations of various SciML techniques in comparison to traditional numerical methods for solving differential equations.
	\item Effectively employ deep learning libraries (PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow) leveraging automatic differentiation and best practices for reproducible SciML research and development, culminating in substantial project implementations.

\section*{Assessment}
Your grade (G) will be computed based on the following formula:
\[ G = 0.30H + 0.30E + 0.40FP \]
where:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{H (Homework - 30\%):} Weekly assignments combining theoretical analysis, mathematical derivations, and programming implementations
	\item \textbf{E (Exam - 30\%):} Comprehensive examination covering theoretical foundations and practical applications (Date TBC)
	\item \textbf{FP (Final Project - 40\%):} Comprehensive capstone project involving novel application, method development, or rigorous comparative analysis
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Graduate Research Philosophy:} This assessment structure reflects the realities of graduate-level scientific research, where success depends on sustained investigation, iterative development, and the ability to synthesize theory with implementation. Students develop expertise through deep engagement with challenging problems rather than performance on isolated examinations.

\subsection*{Assessment Details}

The scale shown above represents minimum bounds. Adjustments may be made based on class performance.

\section*{Grace Policy (Time-Bank)}
Sometimes we have bad days, bad weeks, and bad semesters. In an effort to accommodate any unexpected, unfortunate personal crisis, I have built "time banks" into our course. You do not have to utilize this policy, but if you find yourself struggling with unexpected personal events, I encourage you to contact me as soon as possible.

\textit{Each student will get a total of 7 days of NO QUESTIONS ASKED extension for homework and project deadlines. It is up to each student to use those days at once or for multiple assignments. These will be accounted for in increments of 1-day and should be requested through email (indicating proposed submission date) 24hrs before the original deadline.}

\section*{Course Attendance}
Students are \textbf{expected to attend all class periods}. Those who fail to attend class regularly are inviting scholastic difficulty. Students are responsible for material covered in class, even if absent for authorized activities. \textit{It is crucial to communicate with your project team members; you are responsible for letting both the instructor and your team know if you cannot make it to class.}
\textbf{Excused Absence:} If you plan to miss class due to religious observance, please provide at least two weeks advance notice. For further information: \href{http://catalog.utexas.edu/general-information/academic-policies-and-procedures/attendance/}{UT Attendance Policy}

\section*{Computing Resources}
\textbf{Cloud Access:} The class will use Google Colab for all assignments, in-class materials, and projects. Access directly at \href{https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb}{Google Colab}. Your UT Email account provides direct access. Students may also use \href{https://repl.it/}{Repl.it} as an alternative online IDE.
\textbf{High-Performance Computing:} For larger projects, students will have access to university computing clusters through TACC (Texas Advanced Computing Center). Training sessions will be provided.

\section*{Academic Integrity}
Each student is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code: "\textit{As a student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values of the University and uphold academic integrity.}" \textbf{Plagiarism is taken very seriously at UT.} If you use words or ideas that are not your own, you must cite your sources. Copying solutions from online sources (Chegg, CourseHero) is considered cheating.

You are \textbf{welcome and encouraged to use AI/Large Language Models} (Gemini, Claude, etc.) for your assignments and projects. Please see acceptable AI tool use: \href{https://security.utexas.edu/ai-tools}{UT AI Tools Policy}. However, you must understand and be able to explain any code or solutions you submit.

\subsection*{Collaboration Policy}
Students are encouraged to discuss course topics and collaborate on understanding concepts. However:
\begin{itemize}
	\item All submitted work must be your own individual effort
	\item You may discuss approaches but must implement solutions independently  
	\item Identical code or solutions are not acceptable
	\item Proper attribution must be given for any external resources used
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Course Materials}
Course materials may not be shared online or with anyone outside the class without explicit written permission. Unauthorized sharing violates the Honor Code and will be reported to the Office of the Dean of Students.

Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires exiting and assembling outside.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy. Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the building.
	\item Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing during the first week of class.
	\item In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors. Do not re-enter a building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire Department, The University of Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention Services office.
