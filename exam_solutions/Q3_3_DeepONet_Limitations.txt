Q3.3 DeepONet Limitations
=========================

Question: List 3 main limitations of the DeepONet architecture

Answer:

1. Fixed Input/Output Function Discretization
   Limitation:
   - DeepONet assumes input functions are represented on a fixed sensor grid
   - The branch network expects a fixed number of input values (e.g., f(x₁), f(x₂), ..., f(xₙ))
   - Cannot handle variable-length inputs or irregularly sampled data without preprocessing
   - If input function is sampled at different locations, network needs retraining
   - Makes it difficult to handle multi-resolution or adaptive sampling
   - Workarounds: use interpolation, padding, or attention mechanisms (more complex)

2. Limited to Single Operator Learning
   Limitation:
   - Designed to learn ONE operator mapping (e.g., f → u)
   - Cannot naturally handle multiple operators or multi-physics problems
   - For example, cannot simultaneously learn both the solution operator AND parameter-to-solution map
   - Struggles with composite operators or operator composition
   - Extension to multiple operators requires architectural modifications (e.g., multiple branch networks)
   - Less flexible than more recent architectures like Neural Operators or Transformers

3. Scalability to High-Dimensional Problems
   Limitation:
   - Branch network input size grows with discretization of input function
   - For high-dimensional input functions (2D, 3D fields), branch network becomes very large
   - Example: 100×100 image → 10,000 input neurons to branch network
   - Memory and computational cost scale poorly with input dimension
   - Training becomes expensive and unstable for very high-dimensional operators
   - Alternative architectures (FNO, Graph Neural Operators) handle this better
   - Trunk network also needs to handle multi-dimensional query points, increasing complexity
